# VIN-Bladel
With VIN-Bladel you can scan a cars Vehicle Identification Number(VIN) or you can manually enter the VIN.
After the VIN has been inputed or scanned a table comes up with the parts of the car than are needed from the autos class.
The parts of the car are editable if the API gave incorrect information or not enough information.
The app also checks a databasÃ« to see if a car with that VIN has been serviced by the autos class before.
If the VIN wasn't found, the new car can be added to a returning customer or a new customer can be added with the new car.
